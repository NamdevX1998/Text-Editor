# Text-Editor
To create a simple text editor in Java Swing we will use a JTextArea, a JMenuBar and add JMenu to it and we will add JMenuItems. All the menu items will have actionListener to detect any action.
There will be a menu bar and it will contain two menus and a button:
 

File menu
open: this menuitem is used to open a file
save: this menuitem is used to save a file
print : this menuitem is used to print the components of the text area
new : this menuitem is used to create a new blank file

Edit menu
cut: this menuitem is to cut the selected area and copy it to clipboard
copy: this menuitem is to copy the selected area to the clipboard
paste : this menuitem is to paste the text from the clipboard to the text area
Close : this button closes the frame
