# Text-Editor
To create a simple text editor in Java Swing I used a JTextArea, a JMenuBar and add JMenu to it and we will add JMenuItems. All the menu items will have actionListener to detect any action.   

There will be a menu bar and it will contain two menus and a button:   
1)File menu  
open: this menuitem is used to open a file  
save: this menuitem is used to save a file    
new : this menuitem is used to create a new blank file

2)Edit menu  
cut: this menuitem is to cut the selected area and copy it to clipboard  
copy: this menuitem is to copy the selected area to the clipboard  
paste : this menuitem is to paste the text from the clipboard to the text area 
select All: this menuitem is to copy the all text area to the clipboard   
Close : this button closes the frame
